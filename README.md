Altruist: Argumentative Explanations through Local Interpretations of Predictive Models

This paper introduces the "Altruist" (Argumentative expLanaTions thRoUgh local InterpretationS of predicTive models) method for transforming FI interpretations of ML models into insightful and validated explanations using argumentation based on classical logic. Altruist provides the local maximum truthful interpretation, as well as reasons for the truthfulness justification, and can be used as an easy-to-choose tool between X number of different interpretation techniques based on a few specific criteria. Altruist has innate virtues such as truthfulness, transparency and user-friendliness that characterise it as an apt tool for the XAI community.
