F1's value got higher and evaluated and the probability increased
F1 has positive influence, and thus by raising its value it should increased
F1's value got lower and evaluated and the probability decreased
F1 has positive influence, and thus by lowering its value it should decrease
F1 is truthful because it has positive influence and when its value raises locally we observe the probability to increase, while when its value reduces locally we observe the probability to decrease
F1 is untruthful
F2's value got higher and evaluated and the probability increased
F2 has positive influence, and thus by raising its value it should increased
F2's value got lower and evaluated and the probability decreased
F2 has positive influence, and thus by lowering its value it should decrease
F2 is truthful because it has positive influence and when its value raises locally we observe the probability to increase, while when its value reduces locally we observe the probability to decrease
F2 is untruthful
F3's value got higher and evaluated and the probability increased
F3 has positive influence, and thus by raising its value it should increased
F3's value got lower and evaluated and the probability decreased
F3 has positive influence, and thus by lowering its value it should decrease
F3 is truthful because it has positive influence and when its value raises locally we observe the probability to increase, while when its value reduces locally we observe the probability to decrease
F3 is untruthful
F4 has positive influence, and thus by raising its value it should increased
F4 has positive influence, and thus by lowering its value it should decrease
F4 is truthful because it has positive influence and when its value raises locally we observe the probability to increase, while when its value reduces locally we observe the probability to decrease
F4 is untruthful
